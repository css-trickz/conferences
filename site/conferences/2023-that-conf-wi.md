We're excited to announce our annual Summit returns December 1 and 2 2022 in Sydney, and it will be bigger than ever!

Covering our traditional front-end engineering, design and product management, this year we'll also feature a content design and strategy track, a React ecosystem track and a junior developer focussed trackâ€“as always featuring world leading speakers.
